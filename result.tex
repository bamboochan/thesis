Training 25k iterations with a learning rate of 0.0002 gives us the following quantative result:
\input{tab_quan}

Reprojection achieves better result for small objects, as it achieves $0.2$ AP higher than training without reprojection. But in general, the two versions achieved similar results \ref{fig:ap}. 

If we look at the metrics per class, we can see that training with reprojection performs better for objects that are small and still \eg box and bin \ref{fig:ap_bin}. But for object that moves \eg person \ref{fig:ap_person}, it performs worse than the training without reprojection.
