One of the possible directions for future work is to incorporate multiple reprojected frames in the training pipeline, in order to even better capture temporal information from the video. Another possibility is to incorporate the depth information directly in the tratining as opposed to using it just for reprojection, since depth information could be helpful in separating occluded objects. These directions would probably require some new approaches to storing and loading the data, in order to accomodate increasing amount of data in the training pipeline.
