This thesis is advised by Professor Alexander Schwing. I would like to Thank him for his teaching, help and support. I would also like to Thank Raymond Yeh, without whom this thesis wouldn't have been possible. I would also like to Thank everyone in Professor Schwing's Machine Learning and computer vision group for sharing their cool projects in the group meeting. Finally, I would like to thank my boyfriend for his support.
