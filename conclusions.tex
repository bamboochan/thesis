Our experiments allow us to explore how incorporating 3D and temporal information enhances the quality of amodel segmentation. We have also discovered the challenges of working with 3D information, due to the computational cost of the increasing amounts of data involed. We have also seen the different challenges that the task of amodal segmentation poses compared to modal segmentation. This thesis provides some partial solutions to these challenges, and there are definitely more that can be done in this task.
