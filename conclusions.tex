In the experiments with Amodal-net, we identify three challenges for SAIL-VOS: missing temporal information, overlapping boxes, and short-sighted propagation of instance information. % far into the occluding object. 
We address each of the challenges in our proposed Amodal-net using a temporal backbone, a cascade Soft-NMS box head, and an iterative mask-head. Our experiments show that each of the proposed components improves the quality of amodal segmentation. Overall, our model outperforms prior work on the SAIL-VOS dataset for amodal instance-level video segmentation.

Our experiments with reprojection allow us to explore how incorporating 3D and temporal information enhances the quality of amodal segmentation. We have also discovered the challenges of working with 3D information, due to the computational cost of the increasing amounts of data involed. We have also seen the different challenges that the task of amodal segmentation poses compared to modal segmentation. This thesis provides some partial solutions to these challenges.
